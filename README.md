This project in R was completed as a capstone project for a Data Analytics Certificate at the University of Washington School of Professional and Continuing Education. It uses an open source People Analytics database developed by Dr. Carla Patalano and Dr. Rich Huebner at the New England College of Business. Here I employ machine learning concepts to model employee retention, specifically voluntary termination (employees leaving).
